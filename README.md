## Safu Lock - Presentation Website

This is a presentation website for a Crypto project that is built on Binance Smart Chain. The project is live on Testnet and it is fully working, however it is not meant to be used for production.

### Used technologies

I have used `HTML`, `CSS` / `SCSS` and `Vanilla JavaScript` to design the website and give it functionality.

To display the latest locks ([from this App](https://iustinionita.github.io/app-safu-lock/ "from this App")) and display live data, this project is using the `Web3` library along with an `API` that will handle a larger volume of data - so this way the transactions from the Smart Contract can be displayed in bulk without having to call the Smart Contract for every transaction individually.
